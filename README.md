# PBLJ-lab-Experiment-7 (Java Database Connetivity)

## Topics Covered

### 1. Database Connectivity
- Types of Drivers for connection, Connection Example. CRUD operations using Database, Configuring various types of drivers for Java Database Connectivity
-  MVC Model for project development, Sequence, Dual table, Date type management in Java.

  
## ðŸ“Œ Experiment 7: Create Java applications with JDBC for database connectivity, CRUD operations, and MVC architecture.

| Program    | Description                                 |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **[7.1) Easy](/Exp7.1.java)** |Create a Java program to connect to a MySQL database and fetch data from a single table. The program should: Use DriverManager and Connection objects. Retrieve and display all records from a table named Employee with columns EmpID, Name, and Salary.. |
| **[7.2) Medium](/Exp7.2.java)** |Build a program to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a database table Product with columns: ProductID, ProductName, Price, and Quantity. The program should include: Menu-driven options for each operation. Transaction handling to ensure data integrity. |
| **[7.3) Hard](/Exp7.3.java)** | Develop a Java application using JDBC and MVC architecture to manage student data. The application should: Use a Student class as the model with fields like StudentID, Name, Department, and Marks. Include a database table to store student data. Allow the user to perform CRUD operations through a simple menu-driven view. Implement database operations in a separate controller class.|
